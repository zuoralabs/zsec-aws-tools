==============
zsec-aws-tools
==============

A library for making AWS API nicer to use.



Installation
============

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/zuoralabs/zsec-aws-tools.git@master

or add to `install_requires` in `setup.py` for your module.

.. code:: py

    install_requires = [
        'zsec-aws-tools @ git+https://github.com/zuoralabs/zsec-aws-tools.git@master',
    ]


Testing
========

The test suite uses pytest. Before running tests, run `testing/utils/setup-test-resource-table.py`
in your test account.


Usage
=====

The main pattern is to use `AWSResource` objects to describe resources and then
to call `AWSResource.put` when you want to make the remote environment match your code.
`put` is idempotent.

An `AWSResource` takes the following initialization params:

- `session`: AWS session.
- `region_name`: AWS region name, such as `us-east-1`.
- `ztid`: A UUID used to identify resources over name changes. For example, to rename a bucket,
  the IAM role needs to be deleted and a copy with the new name created. Using the UUID, you
  can still identify the role in your code with the new actualized role when you change the
  name.
- `name` or `index_id`: the `index_id` is used to identify the resource for describing
  the resource. The AWS API is inconsistent about how it identifies resources. For example when you
  call `GetRole`, you pass the `RoleName`, but for `GetPolicy`, you pass the `PolicyArn`.
  You can check the `index_id_name` attribute to see what to pass as `index_id`. For example,
  `Role.index_id_name = "RoleName"` and `Policy.index_id_name = "PolicyArn"`.
- `config`: a dictionary containing the configuration for the resource. This usually takes
  the same input as boto3 creation function for the resource type. This is used
  by `AWSResource.put`. More details below.

The most complicated part is `config`, which declares what you want the resource to look like
after `put`. If any of the values in the `config` dictionary are callable, they will
be called on the resource before being used in a call to the AWS API. This is useful
when the config depends on an attribute of the resource itself. For example, a resource
policy may require the resource ARN, which is most convenient to calculate after the resource
has been defined.


Why
====

This library aims to solve deployment and operating configuration problems in AWS.

There is not always a clear separation between deployment and operating config. 
Some parts of a resource configurations should be controlled manually, some automatically
derived during operation, and some at deployment time. 

While deployment mechanisms such as Terraform/Cloudformation can manage
deployments, they do not play well with dynamic reconfiguration and 
configuration using other methods.

Furthermore, this library aims to be robust. Infrastructure-as-code requires
state to be matched with code, and this mapping can become out of sync and
corrupted. This library is meant to facilitate recovery from corrupted mapping
between state and code.
